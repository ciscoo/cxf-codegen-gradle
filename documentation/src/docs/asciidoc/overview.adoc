The goal of this document is to provide reference documentation for developers utilizing the CXF Codegen Gradle plugin.

[[what-is-cxf-codegen-gradle]]
== What is CXF Codegen

CXF Codegen is a Gradle plugin port of the {cxf-codegen-maven-plugin}[Maven plugin].
The Gradle plugin offers an API similar to the one offered by the Maven plugin.
The API is not a 1:1 port and leans heavily on Gradle idioms and conventions.

.Gradle Version Support
****
To keep the plugin as simple as possible, there will not be any _extensive_ version specific workarounds for older versions
of Gradle or any Gradle version for that matter. Trivial or simple workarounds are fine.

However, the recommended minimum Gradle version is Gradle 6 (6.8 or later). This recommended minimum aligns with Spring
Boot Gradle Plugin 2.6.3, but without the strict requirement.
****

The plugin is fully tested against the above versions to ensure compatibility. View
the source of the {functional-test}[functional tests] for more details.

Gradle's {configuration-cache}[configuration cache] is supported when using Gradle 6.6 or later.

WARNING: All examples are written for _and_ are tested for Gradle {current-gradle-version}.
Depending on your Gradle version, you may need to adapt the example to a syntax that is compatible
with your Gradle version.
